This year I have put together a series of full stack MERN applications as well as working collaboratively amongst teams of developers on projects Iâ€™m proud to of been a part of. Recently I finished Makers - a highly selective 16 week programming bootcamp - building on my self-led experience since early 2019.  

In this I built Shuttr in my team over two weeks. It was a photo sharing and location discovery application using React and NodeJS, it allowed users to sign up and post photos which I designed with my team and created the Google Maps API connection that dynamically updated pins from MongoDB. 

I combine this technical knowledge with over eight years of freelance photography and videography, during which my creativity was pushed to new heights, working with global brands like Red Bull, AirBnb, and Shazam. Since then I've integrated this creativity into my problem solving which I've used in my development strategies throughout my projects. 

I'm motivated to join a team in which I can innovate and grow, contributing my attention to detail and ability to follow best practices. 

**Tech Skills**: Javascript, React, Ruby, Next.js, Node.js, HTML, CSS

## Projects

| Project   | Description | Time | Technologies |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|--------------|
| [shuttr](https://github.com/philsmithies/shuttr)|Photography location discovery application built using the MERN stack. I worked with various location data API's to produce a dynamic app that helps photographers to discover new places they haven't seen in their city. After design meetings, I realised the UI, making it clean and modern. As well as adding the Google Maps API functionality and integrated cloud image hosting. | 2 weeks | Javascript, React, MongoDB, Express, Node.js |
| [Chitter](https://github.com/philsmithies/chitter-react)|A popular social media clone built in NodeJS and React.I handled authentication through the use of JWT's. The application handles CRUD functionality for each user on sign up and receives a feed through Cloudinary and MongoDB integration.| 2 weeks | Javascript, React, Node.js, MongoDB, Heroku|

## Professional Experience

**Makers Academy** (March 2021 to June 2021)

- 16 week intensive Bootcamp. Followed TDD, XP and Agile methodologies. Had a focus on building apps through pair programming. Worked on problems requiring teamwork and strong communication. Each day my team organised stand-ups where my communication skills were vital in orchestrating key decisions during the project.

- I worked on Object-orientated programming as well as gained Experience with MVC framework patterns. The greatest asset I obtained during the course was strengthening my ability to learn independently.

- During the course I produced full stack apps in Javascript, React, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Node.js, Express. As well as testing frameworks which include Jasmine, Jest, Rspec, Capybara.

**Phil Smithies Photography** (September 2012 to August 2021)  
_Photographer, Videographer & Digital Retoucher_

Portfolio: [philsmithies.photo](http://www.philsmithies.photo)

- Commissioned for a whole range of clients, including AirBnb, Shazam, Sony Music, Red Bull, Warner Music and the BBC. I shot multiple major label artists press campaigns and had my images as part of a Global Spotify Campaign.

- I worked as a freelance creative in charge of my own business. Whilst running my business I had to make sure that my business had good relations with clients to maintain a strong reputation and promote repeat business. I worked on my EQ and was required to adapt my way of interacting or behaviour, when working with subjects from a variety of different backgrounds.

- Negotiated rates with clients on many different project scopes.

- Dealt with idea generation on projects, managing production and communication between clients. This allowed me to create clear communication and time scales which improved overall product consistency.

- Managed expectations and updated the scope of shoots where necessary.

- I developed skills to work under pressure, deliver on short deadlines and edit in sprints.

## Skills

- **Commitment** - Completing Makers Academy remote has been something that I am proud to say I've done. It has taken regular dedication and focus to overcome challenges especially when I've not been in a classroom but it has made me into the developer I am today.

- **Creative** - From working as a photographer I have developed a strong attention to detail. Often on my shoots I'd be looking for a new angle that we could work with and now I am combining my visual ability with my work as a developer.

- **Working under pressure** - I've worked in the past often under pressure doing SDE's (Same Day Edits) which during I had to transition from working to short time frames and producing solid results was something that I believe is one of my strong points. I've taken this and used the same methodology with my study over the duration of the three months of work during my time on the Makers intensive bootcamp.

- **Quick learning** - Throughout my time self learning and on the bootcamps I have finished I've been learning how to work between multiple technologies. Not being a 'tech evangelist' with languages I aim to find the strengths of each technology I work with.
