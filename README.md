An upcoming full-stack junior web developer.  From my previous work in the past I have found the creativity that you can bring into coding along with the feeling of solving that next problem to be something that has stuck with me. 

I am currently progressing through a 12 week intensive course run by [Makers Academy](https://github.com/makersacademy). 

I'm currently looking to start a career that in the current circumstances is remote based where I can expand my skills and knowledge in all things web based as a full-stack developer.

- During my role as a Freelance Music Photographer & Videographer I had the chance to work with a huge range of clients from many different backgrounds. I gained the ability to work well under stress often delivering jobs to clients withing short time frames, as well as being adaptable to do work to spec that would fit each clients needs. During my time in this role I was a Photographer, Videographer, Retoucher and Photo Assistant. 

## Skills

- **Adaptable** - 
- **Creative**
- **Commitment**
- **Working under pressure** - I've worked in the past often under pressure doing SDE's (Same Day Edits) which during I had to transition from working to short time frames and producing solid results was something that I believe is one of my strong points. I've taken this and used the same methodology with my study over the duration of the last three months of work during my time on the Makers intensive bootcamp. 
- **Communication** - 
- **Quick learning**
